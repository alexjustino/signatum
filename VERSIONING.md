# Versioning

Signatum follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

```
MAJOR . MINOR . PATCH
```

- **MAJOR** — a change that forces the user to act: a database migration that cannot be
  reversed, a removed feature, an export format that older versions cannot read.
- **MINOR** — new capability, backwards compatible. This is where release themes land
  (1.1 "the card", 1.2 "the payment").
- **PATCH** — bug fixes and corrections only; no schema change, no new surface.

## Single source of truth

The version is declared in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` and mirrored into `package.json` and
`src-tauri/Cargo.toml`. `scripts/check-version.mjs` fails if the three disagree, and runs as the
first gate in `npm run gates` — so a bump that misses a file cannot reach a tag. The About screen
reads the version from the running binary, never from a constant typed by hand.

## The database schema version is separate

`workspace.schema_version` tracks migrations and moves independently of the product version.
Migrations are **forward-only** and numbered (`001_init.sql`, `002_*.sql`, ...). A release that
adds a migration must state so in the changelog and must be covered by a round-trip test that
opens a database at version N-1 and migrates it without loss.

## Release flow

```
feat/*  ->  develop  ->  release/vX.Y  ->  main  ->  tag vX.Y.Z
```

1. Slices merge into `develop` by pull request, gates green.
2. A release branch stabilises: changelog, version bump, documentation sweep.
3. `main` receives the release branch by pull request. `main` is always releasable.
4. Tagging `vX.Y.Z` on `main` triggers the release workflow: it builds the MSI and NSIS
   installers and attaches them to the GitHub Release.

Pre-release tags use `-alpha.N`, `-beta.N`, `-rc.N`.

The checklist that runs this flow is [`docs/RELEASE.md`](docs/RELEASE.md).
